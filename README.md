# 🍃 🍅 **Tomato Leaf Disease Classification

This project focuses on building a deep learning model to classify tomato leaf diseases from images. The dataset consists of labeled images of tomato leaves affected by various diseases. The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** to automatically classify leaf diseases and help farmers identify plant health issues.

## 📋 **Dataset Description**

- **Training Dataset**: 10,000 labeled images of tomato leaves, each associated with a disease category.
- **Test/Validation Dataset**: 1,000 labeled images used for evaluation and model validation.
- **Classes**: Images are labeled based on different tomato leaf diseases (e.g., Early Blight, Late Blight, Leaf Mold, etc.).

## 🧑‍💻 **Steps Involved**

### 1. **Data Preprocessing** 🌱
   - **Loading Data**: The dataset is loaded into the system, which consists of image files.
   - **Resizing Images**: Each image is resized to a consistent size (e.g., 224x224 pixels) to ensure uniformity.
   - **Normalization**: Pixel values are normalized (usually scaled to the range [0, 1] or [-1, 1]) to help the model learn more effectively.
   - **Data Splitting**: The dataset is divided into training and validation sets (typically an 80/20 split) to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

### 2. **Model Building** 🏗️
   - **CNN Architecture**: 
     - **Convolutional Layers**: Extracts features from images (e.g., edges, textures, shapes) by applying filters.
     - **Pooling Layers**: Reduces the dimensionality and computation of the feature maps, retaining important features.
     - **Fully Connected Layers**: After feature extraction, these layers make predictions based on the features extracted by the CNN layers.
   - **Output Layer**: A softmax or sigmoid function to predict the probability of each disease category.

### 3. **Training the Model** 🚀
   - **Optimizer**: We use optimizers like **Adam** or **SGD** to adjust weights during training.
   - **Loss Function**: A loss function like **categorical crossentropy** is used to measure the difference between predicted and actual labels.
   - **Epochs**: The model is trained for several epochs to improve accuracy, adjusting weights based on the error during each pass over the data.
   - **Validation**: Performance is monitored on the validation set to check for overfitting. Early stopping can be used to prevent the model from overfitting.

### 4. **Model Evaluation** 🏅
   - **Accuracy**: The final model is evaluated on the test/validation dataset using accuracy as the primary metric.
   - **Confusion Matrix**: A confusion matrix is used to evaluate the performance of the model for each disease class.
   - **Other Metrics**: Metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score can also be considered to evaluate model performance.

### 5. **Inference** 🔍
   - **Classifying New Images**: Once the model is trained, it can be used to classify new tomato leaf images into the appropriate disease category.
   - **Deployment**: The trained model can be deployed in real-world applications, where farmers can upload images of their crops to receive disease diagnoses.
   - **User Interface**: A simple interface (like a web app) could be developed for farmers to upload images and get results instantly.
